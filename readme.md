## **Boten Anna** üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This Telegram group chat bot implement asynchronous functions, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple tasks without blocking the program's execution. The <a href="https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/stable/telegram.ext.html">telegram.ext library</a> builds upon the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio library</a> to handle asynchronous operations. 

The bot is enhanced with OpenAI integration to provide natural language understanding and personality capabilities, making it conversational and responsive to users.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Update TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID after Group Migration
>
>If your Telegram group is migrated to a supergroup, the chat ID will change (it will typically become a larger negative number starting with -100). When this happens, you must update the TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in your .env to the new value. More info: https://core.telegram.org/api/channel#supergroups

## **Key Features**

### **1. Personality System**

Anna now has a unique personality based on a customizable character configuration. The personality profile includes:

- Demographics (age, location, etc.)
- Linguistic profile (speaking style, common phrases)
- Behavioral traits
- Emotional responses
- Conversation styles

The personality can evolve over time as Anna learns from interactions with users in the chat.

### **2. Natural Language Processing**

Anna can now:
- Respond naturally to mentions of her name
- Learn from conversations to improve her responses
- Make occasional random comments based on a configurable chance
- Detect patterns in language and adapt her communication style
- Track conversation topics and user preferences

### **3.Pollen Reporting**

The bot now integrates with Google's Pollen API to provide detailed pollen forecasts for multiple cities, including:
- Current pollen levels by type
- 3-day forecasts
- Health recommendations
- Visual indicators with emojis

### **4. Moderation Tools**

As referenced in the original "Boten Anna" song, Anna can now actually "ban people so hard":
- Kick users from the group with custom messages
- Detect potential spam behavior
- Warn users about excessive message frequency
- Help keep the chat organized

## **Setup**

**1. Install necessary dependencies:**
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot requests lxml numpy bs4 openai python-dotenv
```

**2. Get your keys and tokens:**
- Head over to <a href="https://openweathermap.org">OpenWeatherMap</a> to retrieve a free API key.
- Get an OpenAI API key from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.
- Get a Google API key and enable the Pollen API and Custom Search API.

- Get your Telegram chat_id for the chat you want to add the bot to:
    - open web.telegram in browser
    - right click on the group name on the left menu
    - click 'inspect' button
    - you will see the group id in the attribute data-peer-id="-xxxxxxxxxx" or peer="-xxxxxxxxxx"

- With your Telegram account, execute <code>/new_bot</code> to user <code>@BotFather</code>. Copy the token to access the Telegram HTTP API.

**3. Create your environment file:**\
Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as the Python script and fill in the information:

```
# Telegram Bot credentials
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token-here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-chat-id-here

# API Keys
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your-openweathermap-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-here
```

**4. Run main.py and start chatting with your new bot!**

## **How Personality Learning Works**

The bot employs a personality learning system that:

1. **Records chat patterns** - Tracks greeting styles, emoji usage, topics of interest
2. **Analyzes interactions** - Studies which topics get the most engagement
3. **Adapts gradually** - Updates the character configuration based on interaction patterns
4. **Remembers user preferences** - Tracks frequently discussed topics and adjusts accordingly

You can view the learning progress using the `/status` command and manually adjust traits with `/personality`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'"**
   - Run `pip install openai` to install the OpenAI Python package.

2. **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'"**
   - Run `pip install python-dotenv` to install the python-dotenv package.

3. **"openai.error.AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided"**
   - Check your OpenAI API key in the .env file is valid and has not expired.

4. **"FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '.env'"**
   - Make sure you've created the .env file in the same directory as the script.
   - You can copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys.

5. **"TelegramError: Bad Request: not enough rights to ban/unban user"**
   - The bot needs to be an administrator in the chat to kick users.
   - Make sure the bot has the appropriate permissions in the group.

6. **"Error getting pollen data: API error: 403"**
   - Your Google API key may not have the Pollen API enabled.
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console, find your project, and enable the Pollen API.

### API Key Setup Help

#### OpenAI API
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" in your account
4. Create a new secret key
5. Copy the key to your keys.json file

#### Google Pollen API
